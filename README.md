# employee-management-system

Employee Management system is a program that allows one to do the following:

- View all employees in the database

- View all existing roles and job departments

- Allows users to add additional employees, roles, and departments along with their corresponding manager.

- Update existing employees by assigning them new roles.

This was created using Javascript, Inquirer library to take inputs from the user, and MySQL2 library to retrive information from SQL databases.
